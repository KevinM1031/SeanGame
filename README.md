# SeanGame

An early attempt to learn GUI programming in Java in order to apply the knowledge gained in class to create applications which are more user-friendly than console. Here, the player must control "Sean" using buttons on screen to eat the food before time runs out. The timer shortens after every 10 successful iterations, and the game continues until the player fails to feed "Sean".
